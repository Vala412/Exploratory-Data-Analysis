### **Exploratory Data Analysis on Haberman Cancer Detection Dataset**

This folder contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the Haberman Cancer Detection dataset. The dataset includes information on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer, with three key features:

- **Age**: Age of the patient at the time of surgery.
- **Operation Year**: Year when the surgery was performed.
- **Axillary Nodes**: Number of positive axillary nodes detected.

#### **Objectives:**
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, renaming columns, and correcting data types.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Summary statistics to understand the central tendency, variability, and distribution of the data.
- **Visualization**:
  - **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution plots, box plots, and violin plots for each feature.
  - **Bivariate Analysis**: Scatter plots, KDE plots, and joint plots to explore relationships between features.
  - **PDF and CDF**: Probability density functions and cumulative distribution functions to understand the distribution of age, operation year, and axillary nodes.
- **Insights**: Identifying patterns related to patient survival based on age, operation year, and the number of axillary nodes.

#### **Key Findings:**
- **Age vs. Survival**: Analysis of how patient age impacts survival rates.
- **Operation Year Trends**: Insights into trends across different operation years.
- **Axillary Nodes and Survival**: The relationship between the number of positive axillary nodes and patient survival rates.

#### **Tools and Libraries**:
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
